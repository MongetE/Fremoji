# Fremoji

*Disclaimer*  
This project was a mentored project, led in collaboration with 3 other sutdents.
Out of respect for their work, only my work is disclosed in this repository. As
a result, I do not make the corpus publicly available, since I was not in charge
of its gathering.

## Context

Predicting emojis was a shared task of the SemEval 2018, for Spanish and English.
Emojis can provide useful insights to a user's feeling and their contribution to
sentiment analysis is studied by Felbo et al (2017) or Eisner et al. (2016), to
name of few.  
To the best of our knowledge, in January 2020, no attempt had been made for French. Thus, the goal of our project was to try and provide a model to do so.
